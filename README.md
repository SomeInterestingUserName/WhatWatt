# WhatWatt
USB-C charging can be shrouded in mystery, especially when you have an unfamiliar cable or power adapter, or you have one of those multi-port chargers that has all sorts of arbitrary rules for how it splits power between plugged-in devices. That's why I wrote this little menu bar utility that displays how much power your computer (thinks it) is charging with. I designed this app to be simple and unobtrusive, and light on system resources--it only updates when it detects a change in charging status. 

## Compatibility
This app is compatible with Intel and Apple Silicon portable Macs running **macOS 10.13 "High Sierra"** or newer. Although intended for Macs that charge via USB-C/MagSafe 3, this app also partially supports older MagSafe 1 and 2 Macs (though you might not see current/voltage information)
